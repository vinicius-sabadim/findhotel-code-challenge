# FindHotel coding challenge

This is the project for the technical interview at FindHotel.

## Considerations

1. The informations for the hotels are being generated using [faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/), except the photo which I got an example on [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/).
2. The layout is not exactly the same as the mocked version for this code challenge, I tried to be closer to the production project.
3. There aren't automated tests for every scenario, I tried to focus in using different techniques, for example, mocking a function and assert on its parameters when called.
